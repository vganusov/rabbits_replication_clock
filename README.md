The repository includes data file from in vitro and in vivo experiments with Mtb isolate HN878 carrying an unstable, replication clock plasmid pPB10. 
The in vivo data are from experiments on aerosol infection of rabbits with this strain ("HN878-pBP10") or a control strain that did not carry plasmid ("HN878")
Measurements include total number of bacteria in the left or right lung ("sensitive+resistant") or the number of bacteria with the plasmid ("resistant"). 
Data on infection with HN878 (strain without the plasmid) was not used in the analyses but are provided for completeness.
